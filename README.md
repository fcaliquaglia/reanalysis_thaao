# THAAO comparison with reanalysis

### TODO: extract better pixel
### TODO: missing ceilometer data (cbh and tcc)

## Reanalysis
CARRA has 3h resolution at 2.5 km
ERA5 has 1 h resolution at 0.25Â°
ERA5-LAND

# THAAO ref instruments
Instrument involved are HATPRO, AWS ECAPC, AWS Giovanni, VESPA, sw radiometers (up and down). 
The reference values are always from THAAO measurements, except for IWV (ref: VESPA) and LWP (ref:HATPRO)

The code can be run at whichever time resolution.
The pixel extraction is done before running this code using cdo remapnn for pixel 76.5, -68.8 
which has a few hundreds meters offset from the exact location.


## LWP
LWP values have issues, at least for CARRA which has been divided by 10E-06 instead of 10e-03 as expected from the declared uom.
LWP values have been masked to nan for values<0.0, and to 0 for values<15.

## ALB
albedo values for CARRA are the forecast ones. They have been masked to nan for values<0.1, since they are unrealistic.

## IWV

## TCC

## CBH
CBH for ceilometer is calculated as the median value over 1 h form the original 15 s time resolution, then averaged for the comparison.

## PRECIP 
It is calculated as cumulative over the resampling time.
